## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (RAG Pipeline)

NYAYA.ai ensures legal precision by eliminating AI hallucinations through a verified Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:

1.  **Vectorization:** Legal datasets (Constitution, BNS Acts, 15,000+ Precedents) are converted into high-dimensional vectors using `all-mpnet-base-v2`.
2.  **Storage:** Vectors are indexed in a **Pinecone Vector Database** for sub-second similarity retrieval.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a query is made, the system fetches the most mathematically relevant legal context.
4.  **Augmentation & Generation:** The retrieved context is processed by **Llama 3.3 (via Groq)** to generate a verified, professional, and cited response.
